# Virtual-Painting-System-using-Finger-Gesture-Detection-and-Recognition

## Project Description
This project allows users to paint virtually using hand gestures detected by a camera. By identifying finger positions in real time, the system can simulate brush strokes on the screen — similar to using an air canvas. It provides a fun and interactive way to draw without any physical contact.

## Objective
To design an interactive, contactless virtual painting system that responds to human hand gestures in real time.

## Technology Used
- Python (OpenCV, Mediapipe, NumPy)
- Computer Vision for hand and finger detection
- Real-time gesture recognition
- GUI for painting interface

## Working Principle
1. The camera captures real-time video input.  
2. The system detects hand landmarks using Mediapipe.  
3. Finger gestures are recognized.  
4. Depending on the gesture, actions like drawing, erasing, or color changing are performed.
